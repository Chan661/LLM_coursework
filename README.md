### Lab 4: Build a conversation system from a collection of research papers.
In this lab, I build a conversation system from a collection of research papers I selected via ChromaDB, LangChain, and OpenAI. I load and create a vector embedding for the documents. It supports content mapping and matching through similarity search of vector embedding, and question answering through chaining with various LangChain's question-answer chain that deploys large language model such as GPT-3.5 turbo.
